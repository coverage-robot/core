     * of tagged coverage which has been carried forward from a previous commit.
     *
     * There's a very particular reason the carried forward coverage isn't factored into the diff
     * coverage. That's because, by definition, coverage which was generated against an older diff
     * cannot be guaranteed to represent the line coverage of the current commit (i.e. added lines
     * will have offset line in the original coverage file, code which has been moved will not be
     * represented in the original coverage file, etc).
     *
     * That's not a problem though, because, by definition, if the coverage has been carried forward
     * its assumed not have changed. And therefore we _should_ be safe under the assumption that whatever
     * coverage has been uploaded currently, is the only coverage which will impact the diff thats
     * currently being analysed.
