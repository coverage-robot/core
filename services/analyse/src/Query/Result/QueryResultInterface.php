         * The ordering of this map is **very** important, as this dictates what the serializer will output
         * for the type property when conversed to JSON. And, by extension, this means it will impact how the
         * JSON values are deserialized back into classes.
         *
         * Specifically, because the coverage result base class is extended in other classes, it **must** go
         * after them in the discriminator map, as otherwise the type will be incorrectly serialized as "COVERAGE"
         * instead of the correct type for the child class.
         *
         * In practice, Symfony will iterate through the map in order, and the first class which is implemented
         * by the object being serialized will be used to convert the type back into the discriminator value
         * (this includes inherited classes).
