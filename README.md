The core coverage platform and architecture for ingesting, analysing, and outputting coverage data onto Version Control platforms.

### Architecture
![architecture.jpg](resources%2Farchitecture.jpg)

### Folder Structure
- `infastructure/`
    - The _global_ IaC modules to construct the static parts of the infrastructure (e.g. S3 buckets, event buses, caches, etc).
- `packages/`
  - The _shared_ packages that are used across the microservices.
- `services/`
  - The _independent_ services which are deployed to handle parts of the pipeline.

### Deployment
Theres _two_ key parts of the deployment model of the coverage platform, both of which are handled by Terraform.

Broadly those are:
1. The _global_ infrastructure which exists outside of any particular service.
2. The _service specific_ infrastructure, which is managed by the service itself, and deployed _alongside_ the service.
